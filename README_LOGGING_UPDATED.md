## 🚀 **How to Use Your Logging System**

### **1. Run Your Application**
```bash
# For Dash interface
python templates/dash_app.py

# For Flask interface  
python app.py

# For CPD demo
python cpd_grid_demo.py
```

### **2. Check Your Logs**
All your activity is automatically logged to:
```
logs/
├── user_actions.log          # User interactions
├── line_creation.log         # Line creation process
├── creative_actions.log      # Creative processing
├── system_events.log         # System operations
├── error_tracking.log        # Error details
├── performance.log           # Performance metrics
└── analytics.json            # Structured data
```

### **3. Generate Reports**
```bash
# Daily activity report
python log_monitor.py --report daily

# User activity analysis
python log_monitor.py --report user --user your.email@example.com

# Error analysis
python log_monitor.py --report error --days 7

# Performance monitoring
python log_monitor.py --report performance --days 30

# Export to Excel
python log_monitor.py --report daily --export
```

### **4. Monitor Real-time**
```bash
# Watch user actions
tail -f logs/user_actions.log

# Watch line creation
tail -f logs/line_creation.log

# Watch errors
tail -f logs/error_tracking.log
```
